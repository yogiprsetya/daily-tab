# Installation

You can use Daily Tab in two ways:

## 1) GitHub Pages (no install)

- Open: https://yogiprsetya.github.io/daily-tab
- Optional: Set it as your browser start/home page in settings.
- To make it your New Tab page in Chromium browsers, use a "custom new tab URL" helper extension and point it to the URL above.

## 2) Load as an unpacked extension (Developer mode)

Chromium (Chrome/Edge):

1. Download the latest package from: https://github.com/yogiprsetya/daily-tab/releases (grab `daily-tab-extension.zip`).
2. Open `chrome://extensions` (or `edge://extensions`).
3. Enable "Developer mode".
4. Drag .zip file into extensions page

Firefox (temporary install):

1. Download and unzip the latest release.
2. Visit `about:debugging` → "This Firefox" → "Load Temporary Add-on…".
3. Select `manifest.json` from the unzipped folder.

Chrome:

1. If you found a prompt "Change back to Google?" click "Keep it"
2. If you found anoying Footer, click **Customize Chrome**. turn **Show footer on New Tab page** on or off.

Notes:

- Updates for Developer mode installs are manual—repeat the steps with a newer release.
- Settings are stored in your browser and may reset if you clear site/extension data.
